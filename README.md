*Bioinformatics Pipelines and Visualization Working Group Resources*

Overview
========
This repository hosts [PHA4GE-developed](https://pha4ge.org/) guidance documents and resources that address common challenges regarding the integration of bioinformatics solutions for the global public health community.

## Contents
- [Rationale](#rationale)
- [SARS-CoV-2 Resources](#sars-cov-2-resources)
	- [Bioinformatics Solutions](#sars-cov-2-resources)
	- [Quality Control Guidance](#sars-cov-2-resources)
	- [Validation Data Sets](#sars-cov-2-resources)
	- [Informing Public Health Action](#sars-cov-2-resources)

Rationale
========
As public health bioinformatic workflows become increasingly complicated, efforts are needed to promote sensible standardization, portability and reproducibility of assays and workflows across a range of environments, contexts and resource conditions. 

SARS-CoV-2 Resources
==================

### [Bioinformatics Solutions](docs/bioinfo-solutions.md)

In an attempt to assist this integration process, the bioinformatics pipeline and visualization working group of the Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) has drafted this living document to help define the major bioinformatics challenges for SC2 genomic analysis and suggest various open-source and freely available bioinformatics resources to address them.

### Quality Control Guidance

{In development}

### Validation Data Sets

{In development}

### [Informing Public Health Action](docs/publichealth-action.md)

In an attempt to assist in the development of visualization tools and platforms, the Bioinformatics Pipelines and Visualization Working Group of the Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) has drafted this living document to highlight the potential of SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance and listed various open-source resources and case studies which are freely available.  

Contributing
============
Contributions to the documents are more than welcome. To propose a change, edit the source files and open a pull-request with the proposed changes.
